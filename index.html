        <p>
            Promised lightning-fast speeds? You're more likely to summon actual lightning through ritual sacrifice.  
            BT guarantees speeds‚Äîat your wall socket. If your device can't connect, that's apparently your problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Foolishly, I thought they couldn‚Äôt charge me for a service I am not receiving. Alas, apparently I am in the wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            AND FURTHERMORE, THERE IS NO OPTION FOR LEGAL RECOURSE.

            You won‚Äôt send an engineer? Fine.

            You can only cancel your contract by calling them. In the depths of your despair, not only do they put you on hold, but they serenade you with the lowest quality synthpop you've ever heard. The CIA would absolutely consider this an "enhanced interrogation method." What's wrong with silence?
        </p>
        <p>
            By minute 38 on hold, you‚Äôre no longer mad.  
            You are spiritually transformed.  
            You are the Old Testament God who would raze an ocean of nonbelievers.  
            You no longer want to fix the Wi-Fi. You want to burn it all down.
